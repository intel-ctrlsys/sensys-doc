% rpm -ihv ./sigar-1.6.5-0.4.git58097d9.el6.src.rpm

# CentOS
% rpmbuild -bb --clean --rmsource --rmspec ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/sigar.spec

# SLES12
# (unless specified otherwise in /etc/rpm, rpm related files will be located at /usr/src/packages)
% rpmbuild -bb --clean --rmsource --rmspec /usr/src/packages/SPECS/sigar.spec

# CentOS
% yum install ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/sigar-1.6.5-0.4.git58097d9.<distro>.x86_64.rpm
% yum install ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/sigar-devel-1.6.5-0.4.git58097d9.<distro>.x86_64.rpm

# SLES12
% zypper --no-gpg-checks --non-interactive install /usr/src/packages/RPMS/x86_64/sigar-1.6.5-0.4.git58097d9.x86_64.rpm /usr/src/packages/RPMS/x86_64/sigar-devel-1.6.5-0.4.git58097d9.x86_64.rpm
```
### 2.1.5.1.3 Dependencies for IPMI sensor

IPMI Util – IPMI util library is a dependency for including IPMI plugin in the sensor framework.  IPMI Util libraries is for accessing Base board management controller (BMC) on compute nodes and for collecting OOB RAS monitoring data from the compute nodes. Aggregator node will need this installed for OOB access to the compute node BMC’s.

You can grab the 2.9.6 version here:
```
$ wget -nd --reject=*.html* --no-parent -r \
     http://ipmiutil.sourceforge.net/FILES/archive/ipmiutil-2.9.6-1.src.rpm
% rpm -hiv ipmiutil-2.9.6-1.src.rpm
```
The above step will install the ipmiutil source code and a spec file in a "rpmbuild" directory and store it in the home directory.
Add the configure option "--enable-libsensors" to the configure command in the ipmiutil.spec file and then build the rpms and install them as discribed here:
```
% rpmbuild -bb SPECS/ipmiutil.spec

# SLES12
% zypper --no-gpg-checks --non-interactive install /usr/src/packages/RPMS/x86_64/ipmiutil-2.9.6-1.el6.<distro>.x86_64.rpm /usr/src/packages/RPMS/x86_64/ipmiutil-devel-2.9.6-1.el6.<distro>.x86_64.rpm

# CentOS
% yum install ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/ipmiutil-2.9.6-1.el6.<distro>.x86_64.rpm
% yum install ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/ipmiutil-devel-2.9.6-1.el6.<distro>.x86_64.rpm
```

### 2.1.5.3 Database Dependencies

The database is an optional component for logging RAS data.  At the moment, Sensys provides support for the PostgreSQL DBMS.  There are two options (components) for enabling database support:

* PostgreSQL native client library
* ODBC

Some operating systems might be using a different verison of Postgres (i.e. postgres94). In that case, the spec file for Sensys needs to be modified accordingly.

In addition to database components, there is an option to publish the data to a *ZeroMQ subscriber* where the data format is a simple JSON object with a list of name-value pairs and optional units.  This component is the db plugin named `zeromq`.  This plugin required the ZeroMQ libraries and development packages be installed on the build system.  Note only the libraies are required to run Sensys with this plugin.  Use The build configuration option `with_zeromq=yes` to include this plugin in the Sensys build or use `--with_zeromq=yes` configure command option.  See section [Database ZeroMQ Publishing](2-Build-and-Installation-Guide/2.2-Database-Installation/2.2.6-Database-ZeroMQ-Publishing.html) for more details.

Use...
```
% yum install epel-release
% yum install zeromq zeromq-devel
```
...*or for SUSE 12*...
```
% zypper install zeromq-devel
```
...depending on your OS.

To build Sensys with database support connecting via the PostgreSQL native client library, the following dependencies are required:
* PostgreSQL development package
* PostgreSQL client package (installed as a dependency of the development package)
* PostgreSQL shared libraries (installed as a dependency of the client package)
* PostgreSQL server package (whenever applies)

NOTE: PostgreSQL usually installs to its own directory, so when configuring Sensys make sure to specify the directory prefix for the include files and libraries via the `with-postgres` parameter (whether through the command line or the configuration file).

To build Sensys with database support connecting via the ODBC interface, the following dependencies are required:

* unixODBC development package
* unixODBC (installed as a dependency of the development package)
* PostgreSQL ODBC driver

Installation instructions for these components depends on the Linux distribution.  For detailed instructions for the PostgreSQL packages, please refer to: [PostgreSQL installation wiki](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Detailed_installation_guides).

To download and install use:
```
% yum localinstall http://yum.postgresql.org/9.3/redhat/rhel-6-x86_64/pgdg-centos93-9.3-3.noarch.rpm
```
For more information on unixODBC, please refer to: [unixODBC](http://www.unixodbc.org/).

For more details on the database installation itself, please refer to: [Database Installation](2-Build-and-Installation-Guide/2.2-Database-Installation/2.2.1-Database-Server.html).
